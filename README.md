Predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 First Stage Landing  Success

This project predicts the success of SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket landings using data from the SpaceX REST API and Wikipedia web scraping. The workflow included exploratory data analysis, interactive visualizations, and predictive modeling. Among the tested models, SVM, KNN, and logistic regression delivered the best accuracy. The results showed that Falcon 9 landings are more successful with lighter payloads and at certain launch sites, highlighting clear trends in SpaceXâ€™s launch performance
